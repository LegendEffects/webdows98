## Why?

Why not? In reality this was to help develop my React skills but could be useful to create gimmick applications.

## Technologies

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
